## Introduction

Hospital management system is a web-based application developed for hospitals to manage patient’s data effectively.This project aims to reduce reliance on manual methods of data storage and migrate the data into a web-based system with a GUI. With COVID-19 becoming a pandemic with devastating effects, hospitals are struggling with bed availability; and limited resources need to be optimized. By tracking multiple metrics such as a patient’s admission date, their length of stay (LOS) and doctor and nurse utilization by hospital systems, we can enhance the efficiency of these systems. The project will provide a system which will allow hospitals to enhance their capabilities in dealing with the influx of patients and allowing reports and logistics to be readily generated and be available to the administration permitting the optimization of available resources. The project will provide a holistic hospital management system for hospitals to use, providing all the amenities and facilities of a traditional system, which keeping in mind ability to deal with increased patients during difficult times such as COVID-19.
